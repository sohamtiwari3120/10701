To achieve the foregoing objective, the touch panel according to the invention comprises a display module, a touch module and a first castor oil layer, wherein the touch module is connected to the touch module through a first adhesive layer, and a first sealing space is formed between the display module and the touch module. The first sealing space is used for containing the first castor oil layer. For example, the first adhesive layer is in frame-shape. The adhesion position is located between the display module and the touch module and at the border of the display module and the touch module. The first adhesive layer can provide a sufficient thickness so that aforementioned capacitor effect will not take place. Therefore, when the display module is connected to the touch module through the first adhesive layer, the frame-shape first sealing space for containing the first castor oil layer is produced. In addition, the touch module comprises a touch substrate and a cover glass. The touch module can be connected to the cover glass through LOCA or a second adhesive layer. A second sealing space is formed between the touch substrate and the cover glass. The second sealing space is used for containing a second castor oil layer.

The touch module can be connected to the cover glass through LOCA or a second adhesive layer. A second sealing space is formed between the touch substrate and the cover glass. The second sealing space is used for containing a second castor oil layer. The touch panel and its manufacturing method according to the present invention not only can avoid poor touch sensing accuracy due to the capacitor effect, but also can reduce costs. In addition, since the first adhesive layer and the second adhesive layer are adhered in the outer portion of the touch panel, the touch panel according to the present invention is reworkable.", "claims": "1.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a touch panel, and more particularly to a touch panel having a castor oil layer. 2. Description of the Related Art Recently, a capacitive touch panel has been widely applied to different types of electronic products. For example, the capacitive touch panel can be applied to a mouse pad of a notebook computer or can be disposed on screens of small electronic products such as a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, a global positioning system. However, a display module is adhered to a touch module by using optical clear adhesive (OCA) during the production of the capacitive touch panel, wherein the greatest difficulty is that high defective rate resulting form bubble cannot be avoided when OCA is used to perform lamination. In addition, OCA is not reworkable. Consequently, the defective products must be scrapped. Moreover, when the medium or large-size touch panels begin to be produced, the yield thereof will be more difficult to be enhanced. Therefore, reworkable liquid optical clear adhesive (LOCA) is introduced to perform lamination between the display module and the touch module. However, high yield still cannot be achieved by the technique. In addition, while OCA or LOCA is used to perform lamination, insufficient thickness of OCA and LOCA will result in capacitor effect between the routing of the touch module and the metal frame of the display module, such that touch sensing signals may be interfered and result in poor sensing accuracy. If the thickness of OCA or LOCA is increased, costs are also raised.", "decision": "REJECTED"}

Field Embodiments of the present invention may relate to an organic electroluminescent (EL) device (hereafter an organic EL device). 2. Background Organic electroluminescent (EL) devices may use a principle that when charge carriers are injected into an organic film formed between an electron injecting electrode (cathode) and a hole injecting electrode (anode), electrons may combine with holes to create electron-hole pairs, which may then decay to emit light. Organic EL devices may be fabricated on flexible transparent substrates (e.g., plastic substrates) and may operate at a voltage (e.g., 10V or below) lower than voltages required to operate plasma display panels (PDPs) and inorganic electroluminescent devices. Organic EL devices may have relatively low power consumption and excellent color representation. Organic EL devices may emit light of three colors (i.e., green, blue and red). Organic EL devices may be considered as next-generation full-color display devices.

In order to transfer the power provided by the biases, the chip comprises a layout of power circuits. The claimed invention sets embedded electromagnetic compatibility capacitors between the power circuits of the chip. Therefore, the embedded electromagnetic compatibility capacitors can directly compensate and slow down the sudden electronic change inside the chip, and further reduce the electronic interference and the electromagnetic interference. Because the claimed invention disposes the electromagnetic compatibility capacitors inside the chip, the above-mentioned equivalent resistor and conductor combination can be enormously reduced.

Field of the Invention The invention relates to a chip with embedded electromagnetic compatibility capacitors and related method thereof, and more particularly, to a chip with embedded electromagnetic compatibility capacitors placed between biasing power circuits and related method thereof. 2. Description of the Prior Art As the manufacturing technique in the processing of the semiconductor has progressed, each electronic system (for example, the computer system) has become one of the most important basic hardware in today's information society. Generally speaking, in the electronic system, one or more chips are built-in. The whole function of the electronic system is implemented by integrating all of the functions of each chip. In order to raise the efficiency of the electronic system, the chip works in a high frequency such that the chip can process more information, manage more data, and transfer more data or signals in a certain time period. However, high efficiency and large data management and transmission implies that the electronic signal changes much more frequently. For example, in a digital circuit, if an electronic signal has to carry more digital data in a certain period of time, the electronic level (e.g., currents or voltages) of the electronic signal has to change more frequently. Moreover, when the chip has to process and transfer the frequently-changed electronic signal, a high frequency electronic interference and electromagnetic interference often will occur as a result. These interferences not only wield influence over the normal operation of the chip, but also because of the noise, radiated outside of the chip, other electronic system or even the user themselves are influenced. Therefore, when the chip works in a high frequency (i.e., at a high clock rate), the method of reducing the electromagnetic interferences generated by the chip becomes important information to the chip providers. As known by those skilled in the art, modern chips often comprise thousands (sometimes even billions) of circuit units. Circuit units include: transistors, amplifiers, logic gates, or flip-flops of the digital circuit. Each of these circuit units has to be electrically connected to a bias to utilize the power (e.g., the currents), provided by the bias, to change the electronic level of the electronic signal. This causes the electronic signal to be capable of carrying information and data. In other words, different electronic levels represent different information and data. For example, in the digital circuit, each circuit unit (for example, a logic gate or a flip-flop) that is located inside the chip is biased by a positive bias. In this example, the positive bias is a positive voltage Vcc and a ground bias is a ground voltage Vss. When a certain circuit unit A inside the chip has to transfer an electronic signal to another circuit unit B, the circuit unit A regards the circuit unit B as a loading (e.g., a capacitor-type loading). That is, the circuit unit A gets the power, provided by the positive bias, to inject the power into the circuit unit B in order to establish a high electronic level. This means a digital signal \u201c1\u201d is outputted to the circuit unit B from the circuit unit A. On the contrary, if the circuit unit A utilizes the power provided by the ground bias to pull down the electronic level of the circuit unit B it is in this way that a reduction in the electronic level of the circuit unit B can be achieved to cause the electronic level to be brought down to a certain level. This means a digital signal \u201c0\u201d is outputted to the circuit unit B from the circuit unit A. Because the chip comprises many circuit units, and each circuit unit obtain the power from each bias at the same time, the bias has a very large power supplying loading. Furthermore, in a high-speed chip, each circuit unit changes to obtain the power from different biases in order to transfer and process the high frequency signal. Therefore, the power supplying loading of the biases changes more violently and frequently. This causes a sudden electronic change (e.g., a power bounce or a ground bounce) causing unstable biasing voltages and currents such that the electronic interference occurs. The electronic interference not only influences the normal operation of each circuit unit to form the noise of the electronic signals, but also is coupled to the outside signal wire. As a result, the electronic interference is transferred to other chips. In addition, the electronic interference may become a high frequency electromagnetic radiation such that an electromagnetic interference is formed. In order to reduce the above-mentioned electronic and electromagnetic interference, the prior art adds a capacitor outside the chip in order to absorb the electronic interference such that the electromagnetic interference is also reduced. As known by those skilled in the art, each chip in the electronic system is integrated and installed on a circuit board (such as a printable circuit board or a motherboard) such that each chip can be connected to each bias through the power circuits of the circuit boards. For example, a certain chip is electrically connected to a positive bias and a ground bias through two power circuits. The prior art adds electromagnetic compatibility capacitors between the two power circuits outside the chip. Therefore, when the sudden electronic change occurs, the electromagnetic compatibility is able to utilize the charges stored in the capacitors to compensate for the sudden electronic change. This can relax the sudden electronic change and reduce any related electronic and electromagnetic interferences. Furthermore, in order to compensate for the high-frequency sudden electronic change, the electromagnetic compatibility capacitor should have good high-frequency characteristics. This means that the electromagnetic compatibility capacitor should have a good high-frequency response such that the capacitor is able to quickly respond, compensate, and filter out the sudden electronic changes. Nevertheless, the prior art has its disadvantages. The external electromagnetic compatibility capacitor reduces the electronic interferences through the power circuits of the circuit board. Unfortunately, the equivalent resistor and inductor of the power circuits will combine with the electromagnetic compatibility capacitor. This combining will influence the whole high-frequency characteristic of the electromagnetic protection mechanism. As a result, the high-frequency response is slowed down such that the whole electromagnetic protection mechanism cannot compensate for the sudden electronic change in an efficient manor. In addition, the external electromagnetic compatibility capacitor is installed on the circuit board through the utilization of a processing and soldering operation. This increases the production cost and production time of the electronic system. Moreover, the quality of the connecting and soldering points influence the reliability of the whole electronic system.", "decision": "REJECTED"}
